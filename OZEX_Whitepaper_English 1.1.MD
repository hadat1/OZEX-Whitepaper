### 1.	Blockchain



1.1	Techniques and features of a blockchain

 It is fundamental to mention a blockchain when discussing cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. Many believe that blockchains are leading a worldwide revolution through their penetration of most societies by placing transactions into a ledger. For this reason, many sectors are interested in this technique, including finance, trade, distribution, and pharmaceutical industries. There are specific infrastructures of blockchains in Samsung SDS, Kakaotalk, and even the government of South Korea. 

In short, the most advantageous part of a blockchain is transparency. The credibility based on this technique will be the key part of the 4th industrial revolution. Not only transparency, but also  immutability in terms of the impossibility of changing records of financial transactions and their disbursement in which all the participants took part. This is what is most advantageous regarding blockchains. 

There are three categories of blockchains :

- Public blockchain: Anyone can participate in the network such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. <BR>
- Private blockchain:One institution exclusively owns one network <BR>
- Consortium blockchain: Pre-selected group of participants establish a consortium and control the consensus process, but only those authorised participants can take part in the network. So it is called part public, part private. 

 Most blockchains in the ICO market are all based on public blockchains. This means anyone can participate in blockchain networks and thereby every participant can see all the transactions and verify them. Whereas, the private blockchain is limited to authorised participants and supervisory institutions. Only those who are authorised can access transactions, observe the process and only those participants can validate and approve the transactions. Also, the generation of new transactions is limited as well.  Conversely, anyone can participate in a public blockchain, as there are no central de facto operators controlling the financial process. This means participants can choose their own currencies for their financial activities, freeing them from the regulations regarding those currencies. Whereas, the actual operators in private blockchains are clear and every transaction is technically based on existing financial activities, therefore, the participants should comply with the financial laws and regulations.

1.2	Blockchains and coins

In 2008, an article titled Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System was published under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto and the source for Bitcoin was publicly distributed the following year, 2009. According to the article, Satoshi Nakamoto proposed “a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer distributed timestamp server to generate computational proof of the chronological order of transactions” and this is now called a blockchain. Afterwards, a variety of alt-coins were developed including Ethereum, Ripple, LiteCoin, and Monero etc. Bitcoin plays a key role among these alt-coins. These are called ‘virtual currencies’. Most people who do not have any knowledge of ‘blockchains’ will probably have heard of “Bitcoin’. 
The virtual currencies are the rewards for the participants in the network and this is called ‘mining’. Regarding  ‘Bitcoin’, a coin is mined by a computer CPU solving mathematical problems and decrypting the ‘code’. As a result of this mining, a transaction ledger block will be generated. As a reward for this whole process, the miners can earn ‘Bitcoin’, which is called “POW (Proof-of-work)” The coins representative of this process are ‘Bitcoin’ and ‘Ethereum’. However, the harder the mining becomes, the more computing power is needed to contribute to it. Because of the drawbacks of POW, such as high levels of electricity consumption and computing power, “PoS (Proof-of-stake)” has developed as an alternative. Not only PoS, but also another alternative to POW, which is “POI (Proof-of-Importance)” and so forth.

1.3	Process

1.3.1	 Cryptocurrency exchange

'Binanace' (121 coins exchangeable on the BTC market), ‘Huobi’ (115coins exchangeable on the BTC market), ‘Bitfinex’ (37 coins exchangeable on the BTC market), ‘Okex’ (163 coins exchangeable on the BTC market), and ‘Upbit’ (121 coins exchangeable on the BTC market and 35 coins for the KRW market). Besides that, there are mid side cryptocurrency exchanges distributing rare or creative coins or tokens in the market.

### 2. OZEX

2.1	What is OZEX?

It is a new compound word of ‘Aussie’ and ‘Exchange’. Australia regards Uluru as the centre of the world and given that, OZEX is named after Aussie (or Oz) and aspires to be the world’s central coin in the cryptocurrency market. 
<BR><BR>
2.2	Why is OZEX necessary?

 As the interest in cryptocurrency has been increased since 2017, the number of ICO coins has also risen. According to icorating.com,  92 ICO coins were registered from 2017 to February 2018. In the earliest phases of the ICOs, once new coins were listed on the exchanges, the value of those coins skyrocketed by margins of hundreds of thousands in comparison with their initial value, which apparently attracted more investors exponentially. However, the problem of the ICO has been exposed as more investors got into the exchanges. According to the article “Initial Coin Offerings, produced by Ernst & Young, more than 10% of ICO proceeds are lost as a result of attacks. As an example, Prodeum, based in Lithuania, started an ICO on 25 January 2018 and disappeared during the night of the 28th. Back then, Prodeum promised to “revolutionise the fruit and vegetable industry” by putting it on the Ethereum blockchain. It sought to raise $US 6.5 million dollars (worth 5,400 ETH) and vanished after raising $US 11 dollars in total from investors in the ICO. Another example is OneCoin, which was once regarded highly until it was discovered to be a Ponzi scheme in April, 2017. Before its exposure, OneCoin raised roughly $350 million dollars. In addition, Confido, raised up to $370,000 before vanishing as well. Technically, the trustworthiness of companies running ICOs has been very controversial. It is significantly hard to figure out the process of development and the actual potentials of companies running ICOs without visible outcomes. Some of those companies misused the unpredictable situations and disappeared with raised money. Thus there are websites investigating those scams such as https://icoindex.com/index/scam  and https://isthiscoinascam.com/ 

 As most investors are not experts, people who are keen to invest are advised not to focus their attention on maximising profits. Rather, concentrate on companies running ICOs with clear, uncomplicated visions, which are easier to understand. Also, it is essential the ICO has a low possibility of fraud.   

What OZEX provides:

1.	Convenience for ICO investment
2.	Stability for ICO investment
3.	Profitability for ICO investment


 First, when it comes to the convenience of an ICO investment, OZEX has a variety of experts who have many years’ experience in all stages of the process from mining to trading. OZEX offers investors, holding OZX tokens, the opportunity to participate in the ICO of selective coins. These coins/tokens and ICOs will be assessed and validated by our experts. Secondly, our consultants are cryptocurrency experts and they will study how stable an ICO investment is. OZEX evaluates the credibility of the companies and analyses their financial and technical visions. Thirdly, with regards to profitability, it is generally held that the price of coins and tokens increases above their initial price once the coins/tokens are listed on the ICO exchanges. For example, the Return On Investment (ROI) in NEO is 5253% and the ROI in Populous is 3821%. However, on the other hand there is Nimiq and the ROI was -153%. The average ROI in ETH, according to icostats.com, is 223%. But it is highly possible that an average ROI can be soar above what is anticipated if the core vision of the company and its marketing fuels a rapid ascent. Thereby generating maximum profits for the investor.

### 3	Blueprint of OZEX



3.1	The structure of OZEX

3.1.1	ICO Coin selection

 By continuously selecting the most competitive coins/tokens, the OZEX team generates a variety of investment opportunities for OZX token holders. Also, the team will evaluate and validate the feasibility of the coins/tokens’ profit model, including the coin developers and their viability. 
<BR><BR>
3.1.2	Participating ICOs via OZEX
	
 Once you have OZX tokens in an ERC-20 wallet, you are automatically qualified to participate in the range of ICOs that the OZEX team introduces. New coins will be distributed a hundredth against the value of an OZX token.<BR><BR>
	
3.1.3 Smart Contract

 A smart contract will be automatically distributed to OZEX investors. All the benefits will be given transparently through this smart contract. 
<BR><BR>
3.2	Token distribution<BR>
The distribution of OZX tokens via OZEX ICOs will be in this manner:
	
 If you have 10 million OZX coins in your OZX wallet, you are qualified to obtain a hundredth worth new coins/tokens, which OZEX testifies and validates against the value of an OZEX token you have for 3 years. For instance, if you have 10,000 USD worth of OZEX coins, you are allocated 100 USD worth of new ICO coins which OZEX testifies and validates. (Note, the price of ICO coins and OZEX coins will be set daily by CoinMarketCap's cryptocurrency exchange rate. The standard price of ICO coins/tokens will be calculated on the next day of the ICO. Coins/tokens will be distributed as each ICO roadmap dictates.) 
<BR><BR>
3.3	OZEX Capital Fund Management
	
 The OZEX Capital Fund Management is formally described in the white paper for continuous business viability, stability, and reliable management of cooperation with partners.

 The price of OZX will be evaluated by the market at the same time as OZEX is listed on marketplaces. OZEX is scheduled to be listed in August 2018. OZEX is cooperating and will cooperate with multiple external cryptocurrencies startups to help them with their blockchain related engineering and marketing plans. In return for this assistance OZEX swaps our partners OZX for their tokens/coins.

 Regarding token distribution (point 3.2 of this white paper), when the time comes to distribute a new token/coin, the OZEX team will calculate and announce the essentially required amount of the new cryptocurrency for our partners. For instance, if a partner has issued their new token in an equivalent value of 0.1 USD, the listed OZX price is 0.02 USD and the new tokens to be airdropped are 200 million. OZEX will swap our partner OZEX for 400 million of their new tokens, which is twice as much. See the formula below.

EX) OZX 0.02 USD : New token 0.1 USD = 2 Billion : 400 million

 Furthermore, the 200 million out of the total amount of 400 million new tokens, will be airdropped to OZX holders (minimum 1,000,000 OZX) and other 200 million will be accumulated by OZEX. The accumulation will be sold 3 months after the new token is listed on an exchange, or, if necessary, may be held by OZEX for more than 3 months.

 We, OZEX, will sell the new tokens partially over at least 6 weeks, or it may take longer if we expect the market may fluctuate when we sell the new tokens. This would be done to avoid any influence on the new token's value, market fluctuations, and the possibility of jeopardising relationships with our partners. The number of selling new token, is to secure back the number of OZX  would be an equivalent of 50%—200% and 70% of surpluses will be distributed to OZX holders. (No minimum quantities are required). The reason for the high difference between 50% and 200% is, if it is fixed, it can be an obstacle to flexible fund management. In addition, if an OZX holder is to receive less than 0.01ETH, the surpluses will not be distributed.

 If a total of $2,000,000 is distributed and total circulation is 20,000,000,000 OZX, 1,000,000 OZX holders can receive a token/coin at an equivalent value of 100 USD. It is a benefit to all OZX holders without any limitation of the OZX value and the minimum possession quantity.  The corresponding Block Height information for snapshots will be announced later.

•	The number of tokens and the value of the tokens described above are all examples to define the structural parts.

 This plan will keep OZEX competitive and sustainable, also boosting the business’ continuity and scalability. If OZX's total circulation is high, OZEX will be able to tune in a certain amount of OZX coin, although it will be a very minimal amount. Of course, due to the characteristic of decentralisation, OZX, an ERC-20 Token, cannot be issued beyond HARDCAP. But, it is estimated that if the total circulation is going high, the price of OZX has already increased significantly.

### 4.	Competitiveness

 30 tokens will be selected by the OZEX team of experts regarding the roadmap and the number will increase to 50 tokens and will establish its own OZEX Alliance. The team is developing a secure and convenient way for exchanges considering the requirements of investors and will ally with secure and robust coins to produce a large scale alliance. OZEX has already been guaranteed listings on 2 global based exchanges, unlike any other unguaranteed ICO coins, and we aim to list OZEX on big exchanges by November 2018.
